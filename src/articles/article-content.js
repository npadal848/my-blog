            `Learning React can be difficult if you do not have a roadmap on how to learn and well but once and for good. You might find yourself here and there watching outdated tutorials or tuts that are not well explained through a well structured full blown application. Thus, this is my advice for you and which work out for me and well.`,
            `Before you jump into React, Make sure you know more than the basics in JavaScript, things like functions, objects, classes, this keyword, scope, closures etc..`,
            `As you might notice. React is Just Plain JavaScript. There is no jQuery in there. So being at least a bit confident in JS will help you move like a deer. If you do know JS I will highly recommend you to head to this course entitled The Road To Learn React at The Road to React .This book teaches you more than the basics in React. I suggest you take a 100 days of code challenge to master React through this book. I think you can even finish this in less than 100 days and even tackle Standalone Management System like Redux to help you manage your state in React. You can get this course entitled Taming The State In React on the same site. But first The React book will help you master Plain React. Plus you have a bonus to lean modern JavaScript like ES6, ES7. The course is completely updated and waste no time of yours and teach you the skills you need in React in no time.`,
            `I took those courses and I have applied all the skills I gained from there to build a full blown app named Platolio. You can take a look at what I have been able to build whith those skills gained from the Two books at Platolio (Platolio | Connecting Professionals). This is just to show what you can do one you learned those skills.`,
            `However please, whether you want to learn a new skill to get a job or upgrade your skills or you are leaning for a required project; do take your time to read these two books and in less that 100 days of hard work I believe, you will become a well experienced React developer as of a beginner. Do not just take my word for it. If you already know JS, then try by yourself this course now. I am confident you will thank the author Robin Wieruch later.`
